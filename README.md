## ABOUT THE PROJECT

```
Normally in a Nano-grid architecture, dedicated power converters for both dc and ac loads are used
thus increasing the number of passive components and conductions losses. Here, a solar (PV) based
Nano grid integrated with battery storage is presented which can be used to supply ac and dc loads
simultaneously. The boost derived hybrid converter topology is used in this Nano grid which is
realized by replacing the controlled switch of single switch boost converter with a voltage source
bridge inverter. It also has an inherent shoot through protection in the inverter stage. It also
reduces the number of conversion stages whencompared with a conventional solar (PV) based systems
to supply the ac/dc loads. A non-isolated buck boost bidirectional DC-DC converter is used for
charging and discharging of the battery to support the Nano grid. A suitable Pulse width modulation
control strategy based on Uni-Polar sine PWM is implemented. The Converter is simulated in different
modes of operation. The simulation is done using PSIM software. Simulation results show the
suitability of the converter for the practical application.
